# Astar
Astar is an iOS application that offers many of the features you would find on a Garmin bicycle computer.
It supports all BLE bicycle devices such as power meters, cadence sensors, speed sensors and heart rate monitors.
It also integrates with Strava and CyclingAnalytics.

This was a project that was available on the App Store for many years. 
Since Apple has released their own version via the Apple Watch, I have decided to release this code to the public
